{"name": "chapter 53", "summary": "Mrs. Bennet is crestfallen after the departure of Lydia, her favorite daughter. \n        The only thing that excites her is Mr. Bingley's arrival with Darcy at \n        Netherfield. Elizabeth fears that her mother's incorrigible behavior will \n        surface again to embarrass her further. During the first visit, Mrs. Bennet, \n        as always, talks foolishly, humiliating Elizabeth. She also gushes over \n        Mr. Bingley, while being cold and ceremoniously polite to Darcy. Elizabeth \n        is particularly pained by her mother's icy treatment of Darcy, who has \n        been Lydia's savior. Darcy's behavior, which is solemn and reserved, aggravates \n        Elizabeth's misery further. The only positive thing in the visit is Bingley's \n        marked attention towards Jane, whom he finds as pretty as ever, though \n        not so communicative.", "analysis": "", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190903025227/http:/thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Pride_And_Prejudice_Austen/Pride_And_Prejudice_Study_Guide24.html"}
