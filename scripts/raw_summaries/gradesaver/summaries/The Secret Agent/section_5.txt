{"name": "Chapter VI", "summary": "The Assistant Commissioner turns out to have a vested interested in Michaelis by way of his wife\u2019s participation in the social circle of the latter\u2019s patroness. This upper-class lady took an interest in Michaelis and helped get him out of prison early because of her philanthropic feelings towards his seemingly humanitarian sensibility and the disdain for the bourgeois society that she shares with him.<PARAGRAPH>Sensing that the Chief Inspector is hiding something, the Assistant Commissioner presses him to keep off of Michaelis\u2019 case and to reveal the nature of his connections. The Chief Inspector shows the scrap of fabric he has taken from the crime scene and points out an address \u2013 Mr. Verloc\u2019s \u2013 sewn into it. He has in fact known of Mr. Verloc and the latter\u2019s work as a secret agent for seven years and has visited the man at his shop. The Assistant Commissioner expresses his disapproval for the use of secret agents and the Chief Inspector\u2019s keeping matters from him.", "analysis": "As has happened so often in previous chapters, the point of narrative focalization shifts from one character to another \u2013 Chief Inspector Heat to his superior, the Assistant Commissioner \u2013 in this chapter. As with the socialists, the policemen, who are supposed to work together, indulge in petty power plays against each other and play a conversational game over the question of whose methods are the more effective \u2013 all of which belies their ultimate, comic fecklessness. The element of hierarchy and bureaucracy adds an addition dimension to the humor of the policemen\u2019s situation, as Inspector Heat, being the underling, is forced to express his disdain for his superior in terms that cannot be construed outright as insults. So, for example, he boasts of his longstanding connection with Mr. Verloc, and though he wants to answer the Assistant Commissioner\u2019s question about how long he has known the secret agent by saying \u201cLong before you were even though of for your place here,\u201d he leaves the sense of seniority and superiority implicit by just stating the time: \u201cI saw him for the first time in my life a little more than seven years ago, when two Imperial Highnesses and the Imperial Chancellor were on a visit here\u201d (94).", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210921133003/https://www.gradesaver.com/the-secret-agent/study-guide/summary-chapter-vi"}
